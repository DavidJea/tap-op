### 🎉 Tapop

A game so customizable, it might as well be yours.

👆 Tap, Pop, Smile

No tutorials. No clunky controls. Just tap to play, pop some baddies, and let the chaos unfold. Whether you're 7 or 77, Tapop is instant fun for all fingers.

🎨 You're the Artist, Composer &amp; Chaos Designer

Tapop doesn't just let you play—it begs you to play your way.
• 🖼 Swap in Your Own Villains
Tired of cookie-cutter bad guys? Upload your own images, crop 'em, resize 'em, make them ridiculously epic or hilariously dumb. Your game, your rules.
• 🎤 Record Custom Sounds
Want your evil laugh to echo across the battlefield? Or maybe your cat's meow as a power-up sound? Yup, you can do that too.

🔁 Create. Share. Download. Repeat.

Made something awesome? Export your custom theme and show it off. Want more chaos? Import themes made by others from our Reddit community. It's a remix party, and everyone's invited.

🌈 Mix-and-Match Game Modes

Choose from pre-built themes like "Cupcake Invasion" or "Villain Parade"—or mash up your own using different visuals, sounds, and gameplay styles. From slow-and-sneaky to full-on tap frenzy, every round feels new.

✈️ Offline. Ad-Free. Sanity-Saving.

No ads. No internet. Just pure, uninterrupted popping fun whenever you need it—on a plane, in a cave, or while avoiding your next meeting.
